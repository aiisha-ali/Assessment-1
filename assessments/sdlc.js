const Design = "The design step is where the architecture of the project is built."
const Implementation = "The implementation stage is when the finished product is implemented into software and is sent to the client."
const TestingAndIntegration = "During the testing and integration stage is when the software is checked over and tested for errors or mistakes that must be fixed. Integration comes in when validation testing happens which is when they test to see how the final product looks from the users end."
const Maintain = "This is the final phase in which the software has passed through all the stages and is out and running, in which it is routinely checked in on and updated from time to time."
